Notes is useful for quickly writing down feedback about your designs, to-do list items, and/or your social security number (since who can be bothered to remember a string of numbers these days?).

2. Unpack the zip file
3. Double-click Notes.sketchplugin
4. Wow

#### USAGE (AKA CMD + Y)
Press CMD + Y to insert a new note.


#### Thanks to Zack Schiller for helping me make sense of the poorly documented world of sketch plugins.
